## About
My application allows users to rename TV show episodes using information from the TVmaze API. The app fetches data from TVmaze to provide accurate and up-to-date episode titles, ensuring your episode library is always correctly labeled. Future updates will expand the number of APIs supported, enhancing the app's functionality and data sources.
## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
